# Climbing Persona Definitions

## Overview

This document defines the 7 climbing persona archetypes used for grade personalization. Each persona represents distinct strengths, weaknesses, and climbing style preferences.

**IMPORTANT**: Adjustment multipliers are **starting points** requiring calibration with user feedback. Do not treat these values as final.

## Implementation Notes

### Adjustment Value Ranges

All adjustment multipliers use **ranges** (e.g., ×0.65-0.75) rather than exact values:

- **Lower bound**: Conservative adjustment (minimal impact)
- **Upper bound**: Aggressive adjustment (maximum impact)
- **Implementation**: Start with midpoint, adjust based on feedback

### Calibration Strategy

1. **Start Conservative**: Use lower bounds or midpoints
2. **Collect Feedback**: Ask users if personalized grade feels accurate
3. **Adjust Gradually**: Increase/decrease by 0.05 increments
4. **Monitor Satisfaction**: Track persona-specific satisfaction scores
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on aggregate feedback

### Context-Specific Application

Adjustments only apply when route characteristics match persona strengths/weaknesses:

- **Slab Specialist** adjustments only apply on slab OR overhang routes
- **Crimp Specialist** adjustments only apply on crimp-heavy OR sloper-heavy routes
- **Power Climber** adjustments apply on overhangs AND/OR wide spacing routes

**Do NOT apply adjustments indiscriminately** - only when route characteristics are detected.

## Summary

Each persona has:

1. ✅ **Clear identity** - Distinct strengths and weaknesses
2. ✅ **Adjustment ranges** - Starting value ranges for calibration
3. ✅ **Context triggers** - Route characteristics that activate adjustments
4. ✅ **Biomechanical rationale** - Based on climbing domain knowledge
