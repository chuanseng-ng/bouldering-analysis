# YOLO Dataset Configuration for Bouldering Hold Detection
# This file defines the dataset structure and classes for training YOLOv8 models

# Dataset paths (relative to this file)
# These paths point to directories containing images and labels
train: train  # Training set directory
val: val      # Validation set directory
test: test    # Optional test set directory

# Number of classes in the dataset
nc: 5

# Class names (must match the number of classes above)
# Each detected hold will be assigned one of these classes
names:
  0: crimp      # Small edge holds requiring fingertip strength
  1: jug        # Large, easy-to-grip holds
  2: sloper     # Rounded holds requiring open-hand grip
  3: pinch      # Holds gripped by pinching between thumb and fingers
  4: pocket     # Holds with holes or indentations for fingers

# YOLO Label Format (one .txt file per image):
# Each line represents one bounding box:
# <class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
# All values are normalized to [0, 1] relative to image dimensions
# 
# Example label file (image_001.txt):
# 0 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.15    # crimp at center-left
# 1 0.7 0.6 0.2 0.25    # jug at lower-right
# 3 0.2 0.8 0.12 0.18   # pinch at bottom-left

# Notes:
# - Image and label files must have matching names (except extension)
# - Images: image_001.jpg -> Labels: image_001.txt
# - Empty label files are allowed for images with no holds
# - Recommended train/val split: 80/20 or 90/10
